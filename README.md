# Introduction
This project is an implementation of a room matching Build a machine learning API similar to the Cupid APIâ€™s Room Match feature. The API handles POST requests and returns sample request/response payloads in a similar format to the Cupid Room Match API. 

Internally the API uses an ML model to determine whether two pair of rooms are referring to the same room or not.

# Data Collection
## Current status
A synthetic dataset is created by randomizing different room sizes, synonyms, additions. The logic of this can be found in `rooms/synthetic_data.py`.

These are some examples of rooms that do match:

## Next steps
1. Do some extra iterations on the synthetic data augmentation. Include different techniques like accent variations and different languages.
2. Use real cases. Probably at some point we would have access to existing dataset examples of pairs that should(not) match. It would be good to use them as training dataset and even augment these real examples with some random word spinning/additions

# Data processing
From `rooms/data_processing.py`
## Preprocessing
These are the steps used to transform the raw input strings to normalized strings:
1. Fill any missing values with empty strings. This ensures that all elements in the Series are strings, preventing errors in subsequent string operations.
1. Convert all strings to lowercase. This helps standardize the text and makes comparisons case-insensitive.
1. Removes any characters that are not alphanumeric (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) or whitespace. This step helps clean the text by removing punctuation, special characters, and other non-alphanumeric symbols.

## Feature-extraction
Each pair of normalized room names is represented with four different features to the downstream ML model. Each feature captures different types of patterns that should give enough formation to determine whether the two rooms are the same (match) or not.

1. `cosine_similarity`. This is a string distance that will be useful when some words in one room name appear (or not) in the other. Steps:
   1. TFIDF representation is calculated for each room name
   2. cosine similarity is calculated between each two TFIDF vectors.
3. `levenshtein_distance`. A type of string edit distance that contemplates insertions, deletions and substitutions. Useful when the words are not exactly the same, but similar. Especially useful in cases like "...with a nice view" vs "...with nice views" (singular/plural variations) or "excutive suite" vs "executive suite" (typos)
4. `jaro_winkler_similarity`. A type of string edit distance that contemplates transpositions and that gives more weight to matching characters at the beginning of the strings.
5. `embedding_cosine_similarity`. A string distance metrix that captures semantic similarity, for example in "affordable" vs "cheap". It uses a pretrained transformer based architecture called MiniLM, which is a smaller version (80mb) of the BERT model. It's pre-trained on a massive dataset of text using a self-supervised contrastive learning objective. This training process teaches the model to generate similar embeddings for sentences with similar meanings and different embeddings for sentences with different meanings. This model is fetched from hugging face and is used like this:
   1. Get embeddings for each room name
   2. cosine similarity is calculated between each two embedding vectors.

# Model development
From `rooms/model_creation.py`

LightGBM was used for the binary classification task.
Model development is done by first randomly spliting the full dataset into train validation and test sets.

## Hyperparameter tuning
First, Hyperparamter optimization is done on both the train and validation sets (see `notebooks/hyperparameter_tuning_lgbm.ipynb`). The technique used is a pre-built routine in the `optuna` package specifically made for lightgbm where these hyperparameters are optimized in a stepwise manner: `lambda_l1`, `lambda_l2`, `num_leaves`, `feature_fraction`, `bagging_fraction`, `bagging_freq` and `min_child_samples`.

At the end of this step we know which are the best hyperparameters to use for the final training.

## Training the final model
Train set is used to train the LightGBM model.

Validation set is used to
1. Determine the stopping criteria of training to limit model complexity and avoid overfitting
1. Determine the threshold to be used to achieve a given minimum precision. A minimum precision on the validation set was fixed at 80%

## Evaluation

Test set is used to calculate the final evaluation. Different metrics are calculated and logged to MLflow but these are the main ones:
1. Threshold insensitive:
   1. The area under the precision recall curve is around 75%
8. Threshold sensitive (using the threshold derived from validation set):
   1. precision 78%
   1. recall 46%

## Deployment

These artificats are then stored in MLflow:
- Fitted preprocessing pipeline
- Fitted LGBM model
- Evaluation metrics

![mlflow_single_model.png](images/mlflow_single_model.png)

I trained a bunch of different models with default hyperparameters first and then with the tuned hyperparameters, with MLflow we can easily compare their performances. We see that the top one (tuned) is marginally better than the others, meaning that hyperparamter optimization makes the model better but it is not a game changer.

# POC Deployment

Flask is used (`rooms/app.py`) to create the API. These are the steps to run it.

First we have to set up the python virtual environment. For that we need tp install `poetry` and then run 
```commandline
poetry install
```
Then we need to train the model and deploy it to MLFlow. We do that by running:
```commandline
python rooms/model_creation.py
```
Afterwards we have to start the flask app to start listening to the requests. We do that by running:
```commandline
python rooms/app.py
```

And that's it, we can start hitting the API and getting results.

For how to use the API please refer to the postman collection in `Room Matching API.postman_collection.json`

# Testing

All the tests are included in `test` folder. A coverage report is provided in the `htmlcov`.

In order to run the integration test we need to have successfully run this before:
```commandline
python rooms/app.py
```

# Scalability
## Handling increased traffic

1. Load balancing: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of your Flask API. This prevents any single instance from being overwhelmed. We could use load balancers like Nginx, HAProxy, or cloud-based load balancers (AWS Elastic Load Balancing, Google Cloud Load Balancing).
1. Horizontal scaling: Increase the number of Flask API instances as needed to handle the traffic. This can be done manually or automatically using auto-scaling features provided by cloud platforms.
1. Caching: Cache frequently accessed data or predictions to reduce the load on your API and improve response times. You can use in-memory caches like Redis or Memcached, or content delivery networks (CDNs) for static assets.
1. Asynchronous tasks: For long-running tasks (like model training or complex data processing), use asynchronous task queues like Celery to offload the work to background workers. This keeps your API responsive and prevents requests from being blocked.

## Handling larger datasets
1. Data partitioning: Divide your dataset into smaller chunks and distribute them across multiple machines or databases (for example using hadoop). This allows to scale your data storage and processing capabilities.
1. Distributed training: For larger models or datasets, use distributed training techniques to train your model across multiple machines. This reduces training time and allows to handle larger datasets.
1. Monitoring: Set up monitoring tools (like Prometheus or Grafana) to track API performance, resource usage, and error rates. This helps you identify bottlenecks and scale proactively.
1. Cloud platforms: Consider using cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) for easier scaling and management of your infrastructure.
Containerization: Use Docker to containerize your Flask API and MLflow model for consistent deployment and easier scaling across different environments.
1. Orchestration: For complex deployments, use container orchestration tools like Kubernetes to manage and scale your containers.

By incorporating these strategies into your API design and deployment, we can ensure that it can handle increased traffic and larger datasets, providing a reliable and scalable solution for your room-matching task.
